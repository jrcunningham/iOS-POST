iOS-POST
========

A simple boilerplate for sending a POST request to a server.

This repo does NOT contain any server side code. Just put in your ip name and modify the body to what you specifily want to send. Upon the touch of the send button the request will execute, and the returned data will be displayed.

Please note this is a very basic boilerplate, intended for my own use, feel free to use at you own risk.
